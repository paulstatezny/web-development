Add sections about:

 - Configuration (environment specific)
 - REST?
 - Code generation vs. "Abstract classes" and such
 - Passing in options to functions via option hashes (objects/associative arrays) rather than having long param lists.
 - Encapsulating common tasks via scripts and a central "script facade" (e.g. npm run ___ or Makefile)
 - Naming idiom for JavaScript event handler selector classes: `js-some-name`
